\textbf{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Identify how many packets the encoder must generate, for the decoder to decode the data, with systematic mode ON and OFF.}\\ 
    ...\\
    \textit{ - Do you need to increase the amount of coded packages generate to decode the data with systematic mode OFF?}\\
    ...
    \item \textit{Identify if changes in g and k affect the number of packages generated. Note down your configurations for g and k.}\\
    ...
    \item \textit{Based, on your knowledge of RLNC, Storage Systems, and Systematic Mode, is systematic mode a beneficial thing or not? In either case argue why.}\\
    ...
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exercise 3:}
Using the supplied Python and image, we have answered the following quiestions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{How many clouds can you take down before it becomes impossible to decode the image.}\\
    ...
    \item \textit{Does the configuration for g and k effect the above. Choose your own g and k.}\\
    ...
    \item \textit{Reflect on what you observer}\\
    ...
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exercise 4:}
\underline{\textit{Why RLNC should/shouldn't be used in distributed storage, and if you see an alternative:}}\\
