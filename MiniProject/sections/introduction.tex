\section{Introduction}
This paper is a mini-project in the Distributed Storage course at Aarhus University. The objective is to investigate different strategies for reliable file storage systems. The first strategy is file replication on multiple nodes in a cluster and the second strategy is using erasure coded block storage. Each strategy is examined with two different cases. The cases differs on how the distribution of the data is handled. The mini-project includes implementation of the storage systems on a Raspberry Pi (RPi) cluster. The cluster consists of 4 RPi 2s interconnected with a network switch. Node 1 is the lead node, which exposes a REST API endpoints for upload and download using the different strategies to end-users. Node 2, 3 and 4 exposes REST API endpoint to the lead node for the different strategies and cases. The solution is written in \texttt{Python} using \texttt{Flask} \cite{flask}. \texttt{Flask} is a micro framework to develop REST APIs. The implementation of the two strategies and cases will be measured using time metrics for upload and download of different file sizes. For erasure coding the overhead introduced by encoding and decoding using \texttt{kodo-python} \cite{kodo} is also measured. Kodo-python is an erasure coding library supporting RLNC. The two strategies and cases will be evaluated by a comparison.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows; Section \ref{sec:repl} describes the replication strategy and the results obtained. Section \ref{sec:ec} describe the erasure coding strategy and the results obtained. Section \ref{sec:comp} compares the strategies. Section \ref{sec:dis} discusses different implementation approaches. Lastly section \ref{sec:conc} concludes upon the mini-project outcomes and learnings.
