\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conc}

In this mini project, two different distributed storage strategies has been implemented and tested. A strategy where the files are replicated to the nodes, and a strategy where erasure code is used. For both strategies, two cases have been tried out. Case A, where the lead node performs the required processing, and Case B where the lead node just forwards the file to another node, to do the processing.\\
No matter which of the two strategies is chosen, Case B is always quickest, with respect to when the lead node is free to serve new user requests. \\
If Case A should be chosen, which strategy is the quickest, to free the lead node, depends on the node loss that should be tolerated. Since the encoding strategy starts out the best, but increases more rapidly as more node failures are to be tolerated.\\
