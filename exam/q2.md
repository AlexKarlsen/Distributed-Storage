# RAID

Describe the principle of RAID. How do you store files? What is a stripe? How does RAID0 and RAID1 work? What is the minimum number of disks to be able to use RAID1? Describe the difference between RAID5 and RAID6. Finally, for RAID0, RAID1, RAID5 and RAID6 consider the trade-off of reliability and redundancy overhead.

As size and cost has decreased for HDD, RAID systems emerged to increase the storage capacity and improve the reliability and performance of storage systems.

RAID stand for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks.

## Level 0

No reliability, actually worse than storing on a single disk. Files are Striped across disks and no redundant info is added. It improves Read/Write performance, as we can Read/Write from multiple disks simultaneously. Best write performance, as no redundant info is added. Data however is lost on disk failures.
