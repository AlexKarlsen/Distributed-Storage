# OpenStack Swift and HDFS

Describe the write operations in OpenStack Swift and HDFS. From a perspective of reliability: which procedure is better at managing and signalling disruptions during the storage process to the systemuser? which is better for handling losses after successfully finishing the write process and distributingthe data to multiple devices? From a perspective of data injection: which procedure is better to increase write speed from the systemâ€™s user? Why do we see discrepancies between OpenStack Swift and HDFS (consider their purposes)?
