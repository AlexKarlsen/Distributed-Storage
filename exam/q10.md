# Deduplication

Describe data deduplication and what benefits does it provide. Does it provide additional reliability to a storage system? What is block-level data deduplication? What is inline and post-process deduplication? What would be the consequence of having no fingerprints/hashes to identify blocks in data deduplication?

Data deduplication is a technique to reduce the capacity cost of storing data by taking advantage of redundancy. It is remarkably different from traditionally file compression.

## LEGO analogy

Think of data as block of LEGOs. Redundant data gives the same LEGO block, thus we can save the cost of storing files as a full LEGO construction, and instead as a description of how it should be build. 

## Block-level deduplication

In the example below, we have 12 blocks to store, using deduplication we only need to store 7 blocks. Which is a decrease of 42 % of storage capacity cost.

The are two basic approaches; 

**Post-process** where the files are first stored to a disk, then deduplicated to another disk, however this introduces a lot of challenges. 

**Inline** Deduplicate when storing the files. 

### Challenges

How do we preserve performance, when introducing deduplication?

Can we support basic I/O operation? What if a block is changed, how would it harm other objects.

Can we use low-cost commodity hardware?

### Basics

How do we compare blocks efficiently?
Block comparison is done using cryptographic hashes. If the content is the same, then the hash is the same.
Using proper hashing function, then no two blocks with different content, should have the same hash.

How do we avoid storing blocks of data not used anymore?
Reference counters.

How do we if a block being written can be deduplicated?
Index of fingerprints, that should be efficient in terms of space (Disk) and speed (RAM). We quickly run out of RAM on commodity hardware. Storing on the same disks can give long search time. A trad-off is spatially store fingerprint and storage to optimize for speed on disks.
